learning firebase adding it to contactform

So i tried React and now we are going to learn how to use Firebase with react but I wanted to try out firebase and learn some basics with the use of vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. 
So here is my first try hooking up a contactform to firebase. 

I will take away the config, but feel free to insert yours if you want to try this out.
